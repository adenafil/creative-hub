    "sellerText": "<p><em>The gods shake their snow globe and chuckle, for the world was not always silent and still.</em></p><p>For those interested in stories about a bunch of misfits who regularly confront the supernatural, fighting to become more than pawns between the games of cosmic horrors. Their company struggles against insurmountable odds, trauma and turmoil which cultivate in their own anxiety-riddled adventures. Magik often draws the ire of ruinous powers, and in a world where isolated frontier towns are crushed by relentless torrents of snowfall, vagabonds take all the help they can get, lest be wiped off the map. The events in my novel start similarly to the Klondike Gold Rush, as pioneers attempt to tame the unbound wilderness. Those at the mercy of the weather quickly discover fate pulling their strings, and beasts nipping at their heels, goading them further into the fray. In a world so untamed, everything may seem bleak and dismal, but there is still much joy in the world, hidden to all those too bitter or driven to drink. Whether we find love in our hobbies and craft, or each other, there is always balance, our light to guide way through the dark. Unofficially, my recipe is one part sour, one part sugar, stir, and lastly, top it all off with a pinch of existential dread.</p><p>After the earth froze over in a great cataclysm, humanity took to the old city’s underground tunnels and survived the chill like vermin. Hundreds of years later, as the clans continue to clash over heat and scraps, people decide to test their mettle by reclaiming the world above only to discover that these lands rally against them by manner of tooth and claw.<br><br>William is one of those second-generation pioneer kids who’d rather forfeit his daily drudges than compete against those vagabonds racing to stake their claim. Alas, as the barrowtide season bears the brunt of bad weather, his frontier settlement is deemed just another lost cause. The young boy Jones is forced into a harsh reality, coming to terms on whether he’ll sink or swim, cast against an ever-rising white tide and the dark secrets harbored there.<br><br>Dealt a bad hand, William faces a hostile world where honest threats are always looming against him. “Those Wyrd and Wonderful” showcases the grim decisions of frontier life, because to thrive, one must first survive. An earnest lad learns to roll with these punches, neither losing his compassion, nor those morals while countless others around him have chosen to forget.</p><h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3><p>A little bit about me, I’m a central Ohio native who has always been immersed in storytelling, studying art, design and all things creative. I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Animation from the Columbus College of Art &amp; Design. My professional background for awhile was in social media, where I managed accounts for a reality enterprise, art community, and several start-ups. Afterwards, I became an aquarium technician, visiting homes to take care of clients’ fishtanks and ponds. Then I decided to get out of the city, move to a small town, and kickstart my career as a writer.</p><p>My work details a world cast with rime, filled to the brim with unconventional creatures and drama, there’s a little something for everyone in his novels. I feature an eccentric slew of characters and down-to-earth grit, where those fictional few are spurred on a path of pure, unadulterated adventure, traversing untamed wilds, and confronting their harsh realities.</p><p>I do have a separate book which I self-published but never really marketed, titled <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://honestthreats.gumroad.com/l/a-world-of-honest-threats\">“A World of Honest Threats,” </a>which introduces the icy narrative. It’s designed as a world-building book for D&amp;D fans, detailing just what it takes to survive in my fictional winter wonderland. What sort of menagerie should navigators expect? Well, there’s the burly bison, timid troll-kin, those particular gremlins led by their pompous kit-king, and even that dreaded tundra terror who all have their parts to play. In a certain twist of events, I actually created my world first. Now I’m writing the tales of those who live it, and it all begins with this debut novel, “Those Wyrd and Wonderful,” the first of many more to come.<br>____</p><p><em>Email me at </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"mailto:marketing.trentlindsey@gmail.com\"><em>marketing.trentlindsey@gmail.com</em></a><em> with any questions.</em></p>"

Jonathan would play a riff and Mike would just stand there with a slack-jawed expression. Jonathan would stop and mean-mug Mike. Mike would play his own riff and Jonathan would try to follow along, but with the peak of the trip coming on, Mike could hardly focus long enough to play in the same key, the same time signature, the same scale for more than a few seconds. Jim on drums was happy to be there, laughing at every false start. That was easy for him to do as he’d be going off to college at the end of the summer. Jamming with us was just his way of killing time until then. Dean on bass just sat there, smoking cigarettes and watching. He had almost no training whatsoever but was pretty good at following instructions and could play anything we tabbed out for him later. It just didn’t give him much to do when it was time to write new material. After the fourth or fifth false start, Mike set down his guitar and headed for the studio door. He had his hands up to his ears and the sweat glistened on the back of his bald head.</p><p>“He gonna be okay?” I asked Jonathan.</p><p>“Fuck him.

Simon is accomplished, popular, and devoted to his unappreciative brother. Auden, on the other hand, wants nothing more than a simple life free from comparisons to his twin. As Auden's solitude leads to insanity, he loses his grip on reality, and his actions threaten to sever his bond with Simon just when he needs him most.</p><p><strong>God Might Forgive Gershwin Burr</strong>: After his father's death, Gershwin Burr turns to stealing books as a remedy for his depression, but his thievery spirals out of control. Despite his wife's pleas to stop, he can't bring himself to quit until he's betrayed and arrested. Imprisoned and tormented by guilt, Gershwin seeks redemption and the identity of his betrayer in this beautifully written novel about trauma and redemption.</p><p><strong>The Anna Geller Invention</strong>: A young poet named Harvey Painter is visited by a fan named Anna Geller, who gives him a single poem before disappearing. Thirty years later, an investigative reporter discovers that Anna has secretly given her poems to people around the world, turning her into a literary sensation. Harvey is swept up in the frenzy and becomes infamous when his poem is stolen. This novel is a tribute to poetry and a critique of celebrity culture.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p><p>Brian Prousky spent most of his life as two distinct people. The first held a day job and raised a family and was public and sociable. The second ruminated over sentences and wrote books in secret and dreamed of a living a literary life. They shared little in common, mostly their obsessions – with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Mozart, Saul Bellow, Roberto Bolano, tennis and hockey.</p><p>Somehow, summoning up a kind of courage or resolve he’d assumed was absent from his DNA, the first Brian Prousky left his day job, revealed his secret and dedicated himself full-time to writing. And the two Brian Prouskys became one. Now the author of four novels, Auden Triller (Is A Killer), God Might Forgive Gershwin Burr, The Anna Geller Invention and Healing Brian Esseintes, as well as a collection of short stories, Jupiter the Stupider, and two books of poetry, Body of Winter and Meeting Poems, he lives and works in Toronto, where most of his characters, who struggle with secret and often conflicted lives of their own, and who never quite fit in, do as well.</p>"

Smith’s first novel</a>, part one of what promises to be a long and fascinating journey. In Book 2, we follow Kate during her transition from girl to the edge of womanhood, learn a lot more about New Zealand society and Māori culture and life, and get deeply into the fascinating world that the author has created from the elements of the real New Zealand and her imagination</p><p>The world of&nbsp;<em>Te Kererū</em>&nbsp;is, as the author refers to it, “speculative fiction,” with the Māori group/clan and its village and the nearby city and lands specifically&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;closely based on any real life example. It seems to me to be a sort of idealized depiction, what could, and may, be in the future. I began to realize more as I read this second book that Kate is an archetype, a Stranger in a Strange Land who becomes embedded in a different culture and (perhaps?) brings new perspectives and a new integration of different worlds.</p><p>But this book is a sort of serial, bearing a resemblance to the great old movie houses where the audience come back every Saturday and watched another episode, with new revelations and resolution of some issues, followed by new complications.</p><p><strong>The big complication is Kate’s budding womanhood</strong></p><p>In this installment the big complication is Kate’s budding womanhood, but with surprising and important differences from the usual and well-worn tropes we’ve seen in a hundred Hollywood movies. Kate is&nbsp;<em>exceptional</em>, in some ways brilliant, wise beyond her years, but also very introverted and some might even say mildly “autistic.”</p><p>In fact, I’m as fascinated by Kate as by any character I’ve read in fiction for a long time. We learn a lot about her, but somehow most of it seems external, the keen observations of others. There&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;internal dialogue and descriptions of Kate’s thinking, and yet even after two books Kate is still something of a mystery to me, and I like that. She seems destined for something big–but what?</p><p>The author has skillfully built a a truly interesting world, and a woman, that I want to find out much more about. And that’s my definition of a good book.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/tekereru2/\">Te Kererū Book 2 – Shaking the Nest</a>&nbsp;on GumRoad includes Book 1 as a package deal, so you don’t need to worry if you haven’t read the first volume.

It is lovely and not something I usually read which is why it is nice to be given the opportunity.</p><p>It really is a gorgeous little story (and I know there is more to come). The descriptive details of the village and inhabitants is great and one can really imagine life there. I quite liked the gang related connections and wonder what is going on there. I expect there will be more to come</p><p>Anyway it is a lovely story, well written and descriptive.\" - Adrienne N.</p><h4>A delightful little book</h4><p>\"The best thing about being on Twitter has been discovering new authors. I also love the humor, but good books &gt; funny .gifs.</p><p>I’ll do another post with the (long) list of fine writers and their books I’ve discovered there, but today we focus on one delightful little book (or Part I of a delightful long book) Te Kererū by Susan G. Smith.\"</p><h4>Kate's something more than what she seems</h4><p>“Te Kererū” is the Māori name for the native New Zealand wood pigeon, a beautiful and tasty bird. When three-year-old Katherine Taylor, a “Pākehā” (white person) is orphaned by a massive landslide, she is adopted by the regional Māori chief–and by the village and its people. Given the nickname Te Kererū, little Kate is different, quiet, mysterious, apparently the proverbial “old soul.” But the book subtly hints she’s something more than this, something bigger…</p><p>Without trying hard in any way, we’re educated about the New Zealand Māori culture and society, something I had only a slight knowledge of before reading Te Kererū. The author obviously loves her country and its people and the book opened up a new piece of the world for me, as I believe it will for most readers.</p><h4>The only thing I didn’t like about this book was that it ended</h4><p>Her style is clear, limpid is the old-fashioned word, mostly short declarative sentences, but skillfully layered one upon another, sips not gulps, and very satisfying, in the long run.</p><p>The story is developed through a series of scenes or vignettes, glimpses of events and pieces of conversations, a technique I also use and can appreciate. Each chapter is a facet of a gem, and gradually we begin to see something taking shape, a mission or a destiny, and…end of Book 1.</p><p>Like the wonderful old movie serials, the present volume leaves the reader wanting more. This isn’t so common these days, but I’m all right with it. I understand the next book will be available soon, which I hope is true.</p><p>Because the only thing I didn’t like about this book was that it ended.\" - <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://neovictorian23.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/te-kereru-book-1-the-nest-by-susan-smith/\">Neovictorian</a></p>"

She fancied herself quite the singer and thought she would someday sing in front of crowds of thousands. Alas, that proved to be more dream than reality.</p><p>A diverse writer of columns, feature stores, short fiction, novels, screenplays and stage plays, Maryann has won numerous awards including being a semi-finalist at the Sundance Institute for her screenplay, A Question Of Honor.

But steady, piercing.</p><p>Harpy stepped closer to me and I could see more detail in her thin, nearly sheer top. It seemed like a dancing leotard. Her long legs took her closer to me in graceful barefoot paces. A tail of cloth-like drape, like the sweep of tail feathers behind, barely grazed the floor and raised small puffs of dust as she strode toward me.</p><p>“Why Harpy, why not Siren? With a face and eyes like that, you can have any lover you want.” I said.</p><p>“Oh, and I have. They all loved me and went to their death for me. Too human. Short lifespans, inflated egos, puppy-dog eyes and utter devotion.” The Harpy sighed.</p><p>“Why do you call yourself ‘Harpy’,” I asked. “The usual pictures are of an ugly monster with really only a woman’s face, the rest are parts of animals.”</p><p>Harpy sighed. “Probably the same reason vampires and other creatures have such bad reputations. You can see my wings and yes I have claws.” She held up two fingers from one hand where long talons suddenly extended from her fingertips, then retracted as quickly. “But that is no different than cats, really. Practically, I can even hide my wings and walk among humans, the same as I’ve done for centuries. I’ve passed royalty and commoner alike and no one has known except when I wanted them to.” She sighed again and looked off into space.</p><p>“May I ask why you brought me here and why I am tied up so tight?” I asked.</p><p>“Because I want you to tell my side of the story....\"</p><h4>Scroll Up and Get Your Copy Now.</h4><p>Also available at most online ebook outlets: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://books2read.com/u/47zALL\">https://books2read.com/u/47zALL</a></p>"

    "sellerText": "<p>The Bezzle is set against a background of fast moving geopolitics, as China is plunged into a deep crisis after the collapse of its real estate and construction market, aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the threat of all out war in the Middle East.</p><p>It commences when Michael D’Arcy, a special advisor to Sir Patrick Kennedy, head of the INI Banking Corporation, is summoned to George Town on the Cayman Islands, where he is to assist Edouard Wang who arrives from China charged with a secret mission by his father, Henry Wang, CEO of the Delta Group, a large diversified Chinese holding, specialised in construction and commodities.</p><p>Unexpectedly Lucy, Edouard’s sister appears. She and Michael have had an on-off relationship complicated by his detention and escape from a Chinese prison in Shanghai, where he had been held pending trial on accusations of economic espionage by the Guoanbu, China’s equivalent to the CIA and FBI combined.</p><p>Michael and Edouard leave for Cancun to meet the Delta Group’s partner in Mexico, where Henry Wang is planning a diversification programme following the economic crisis in China and Xi Jinping’s brutal crackdown on business. During this time Lucy, an ambitious young archaeologist, leaves on a trip to a Mayan site in Guatemala where new discoveries are being made.</p><p>Excerpt:</p><p>It was just before seven in the morning. I was standing on the terrace of La Lancha, a hotel overlooking Lake Peten Itza, in Flores, Guatemala. I was up unusually early. My programme for the day, a visit to a recently discovered Mayan temple in the Parque Nacional El Mirador, accompanied by a local guide who was waiting for me somewhere in the hotel.</p><p>As I admired the view across the lake, I couldn’t help thinking how far away China was and how good fortune had smiled on me.</p><p>I worked for Sir Patrick Kennedy, the renowned City banker. I was his man, at least one of them, but the latest in date. I think he must have felt he owed me something after I’d ended up in a Shanghai jail. No doubt it reminded him of his own little-known run-in with Irish justice a quarter of a century earlier, when he’d briefly found himself in Dublin’s Mountjoy prison, unwittingly caught up in a money laundering scam linked to Colombian drug cartels and the Russian Mafiya.</p><p>I, my family that is, were part of Kennedy’s clan, it was thanks to that I had been engaged by the Fitzwilliams Foundation, an emanation of the INI Banking Corporation, a multinational group headed by Sir Patrick.</p><p>My role at the foundation was the study and investigation of geopolitical events and their effect on the bank’s business, enabling its management to take the measures necessary to offset damage or take advantage of changes—wherever they occurred. My general field was business, industry, raw material extraction, energy, environmental impact and climate change.</p><p>As such, I had considerable freedom and means to carry out Kennedy’s orders in his fast moving universe, one that spanned a large part of the planet, from Hong Kong to the Caribbean and Central America, passing by London and of course Dublin. &nbsp;</p><p>At that precise moment, as I anticipated the pleasure of my visit to El Mirador, Henry Wang must have been feeling down. Far away on the other side of the world in Shanghai, the bad news piled-up, presenting him with a series of complex decisions.</p><p>Henry Wang was a business ‘tycoon’, a word that came from the Japanese taikun which meant Great Lord, though in Chinese he was called a jutou, a big player, which I suppose he was, if his money was anything to go by.</p><p>He was worth a couple of billion dollars, but Henry was a worried man, which seemed to confirm the saying ‘money doesn’t buy happiness’.</p><p>And Henry had every reason to be worried, his real estate construction business was slithering to a halt with the Chinese economy entering a period of almost zero growth, something that was unknown in modern times, at least for anyone in China under the age of 50.</p><p>During the four plus decades, since the death of Mao, China had been transformed from a peasant society into the world’s economic power house, driving growth and expansion across the planet, making men like Henry rich. But now, it seemed that those halcyon days were past and to make matters worse, tycoons like him were not only going bust, they were disappearing, arrested by the police, accused of economic crimes as the Chinese Communist Party scrambled to place the blame for the disaster on anyone else but their leaders.</p><p>The Delta Group, Henry’s firm, a diversified conglomerate, was faced with multiple difficulties, but these were not as bad as those of certain other businesses. He had been wise, far seeing, diversifying into different sectors and above all investing overseas.</p><p>During the three or so years since I was admitted into the inner sanctum of the London based foundation, I had accumulated more experience in the workings of international business than could be have been taught in any business school&nbsp; or desk job in the City of London. That time had been a period of intense on the ground learning, in East and Southeast Asia, and more recently Central America.</p><p>To whom did I report?</p><p>To Sir Patrick of course, though on a day to day basis to John DeFrancis, president of the foundation and close friend of Sir Patrick’s.</p><p>The business of Kennedy’s INI group was essentially corporate banking, providing financial services for large and medium businesses, and high net worth individuals. Services that included, investment, wealth management and private banking. In addition it provided over-the-counter retail banking services, but only in the UK and Ireland.</p><p>And what precisely did I report?</p><p>Well, it all started out with a research programme into deforestation and illegal logging in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim. The Fitzwilliams Foundation had planned to present a paper at the 2021, Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Edinburgh, a report on tropical timber trafficking, a multi-billion dollar business, from the islands that made up most of those regions.</p><p>This led me to China and Shanghai where I met Henry Wang. In fact it was Lucy who presented me to Henry, her father, head of the Delta Group, who was into real estate, construction, building supplies and commodities, including timber as well as diversified investments.</p><p>For my trouble I ended up in prison, a detention centre, on the edge of Shanghai’s International Airport, accused by the Chinese Ministry of State Security of economic espionage.2</p><p>After a dramatic escape, organised by my Uncle John Ennis, I was dispatched to Central America by Sir Patrick, where my task was to report on Costa Rica as a potential site for an investment programme he was planning in the region. There I was introduced to the western end of that chain of outposts which formed the City of London’s offshore banking network, namely Panama, Belize and those familiar Caribbean islands.</p><p>It was there I ran into the Delta Group again. Henry Wang like many other Chinese businessmen and companies had offshore holdings in the British Virgin Islands, including the giants Evergrande and Alibaba.</p><p>Why offshore companies and trusts? For the very simple reason you could do anything you liked with them, and hidden from public view.</p><p>John DeFrancis, head of the Fitzwilliams Foundation, had explained to me how their existence, the islands that is, went a long way to explaining why the UK had left the EU. And why men like David Cameron and Boris Johnson, solid members of the British establishment, set the UK on the path to Brexit.</p><p>A lot of things fell into place after my discovery of those fortuitous outposts of empire, among them the improbable appointment of Lord ‘Call me Dave’ as foreign minister of the UK. A decision that was enough to undermine any normal person’s faith in politics, especially when it emerged that he had acted as spokesman for China’s BRI port project in Sri Lanka.</p><p>The Sri Lankan Port City, constructed by the Chinese state-owned firm, China Harbour Engineering Company, had plunged the small country into debt, forcing it into letting the port to China on a 99 year lease, whilst the UK’s newly appointed foreign minister pocketed 210,000 dollars for his words of encouragement, probably paid into some offshore account.</p><p>Cameron naturally protested he had acted on behalf of KPMG Sri Lanka, part of the international law firm that operated in the City of London. He had praised in glowing terms the BRI report made by another City law firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, commissioned by the Chinese state company, designed to curry favour for the project.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Chinese firm in question had been blacklisted by the US for militarising disputed islands of the South China Sea.</p><p>It reminded me of how, in the same way, Moscow had sought to influence the 2016 Brexit referendum with the object of breaking the cohesion of the European Union. It was part of their strategy in a hybrid war to influence the hearts and minds of Europeans and NATO, waged through political interference and disinformation.</p><p>All that seemed very abstract, academic, distant, and it was.</p>"

He was also a lawyer, a public official, a senator, a painter, an authority on Russian literature and a member of the French Academy. As a public official, Mérimée travelled through France and Europe, from which he drew inspiration for his stories and novels. His first popular novella, \"Colomba\", was published in 1840. It is set in Corsica, and tells the story of the della Rebbia family, whose father has been murdered in an ambush, believed by his daughter to have been perpetrated by the town's mayor, Lawyer Barricini. She implores her brother, Lieutenant Orso della Rebbia, to avenge their father's death, but Orso does not share her passionate ancestral pride. His heart is torn between personal vendetta and a propensity to abide by the law.</p>"

Il monta sur le trône à un âge encore plus précoce : dix ans. Sa mère qui continua l'exercice du pouvoir. Charles IX était tout aussi fragile physiquement et psychologiquement que ses frères. Il était inconstant, tantôt sous l'influence de sa mère, tantôt sous celle de Coligny.<br>En 1570, sa mère mit fin à la troisième guerre de religion en lui faisant signer la paix de Saint-Germain qui accordait la liberté de culte aux protestants, ainsi que plusieurs places fortes, dont La Rochelle. Il se lia peu à peu d'amitié avec Coligny qui en profita pour le convaincre de relancer la guerre des Flandres, dans laquelle la France devait porter secours aux protestants contre l'intolérance du pouvoir espagnol. Sa mère qu'une guerre ouverte avec l'Espagne inquiétait, décida avec l'aide des Guise l'élimination de Coligny. Mais l'attentat rata. Affolée par les conséquences de ce ratage, alors que Paris hébergeait un grand nombre de protestants venus assister au mariage d'Henri de Navarre, Catherine, avec l'aide de son autre fils Henri, convainquit Charles IX de l'élimination de tous les chefs protestants. Ce massacre qui eut lieu lors de la Saint-Barthélemy 1572 s'emballa avec la participation de tout le peuple et s'étandit à toute la France.<br>Tout au long de son règne, il souffrit de la préférence de sa mère pour son frère Henri. Il se réjouit lorsque celui-ci dut partir après son élection au trône de Pologne (1573). Mais malade, il mourut à la veille de ses 24 ans. Il fut remplacé par son frère Henri, le duc d'Anjou et bref roi de Pologne.</p>"

Pour lui, elle a trahi son pays, tué son frère et poussé des jeunes filles à assassiner leur père. Le couple vit en exil à Corinthe avec ses deux fils, jusqu’à ce que Jason s’éprenne de la fille du roi. Qu’il l’épouse, et il héritera du trône. Médée, elle, sera bannie du royaume. Mais la femme répudiée est une magicienne, experte en poisons comme en sorcellerie. Meurtrie dans sa fierté autant que dans son amour, Médée va user de tout son art pour frapper dans sa chair l’infidèle Jason. Objets magiques, rebondissements, effets de scène spectaculaires : pour la première tragédie de sa carrière, Corneille transpose le mythe grec de Médée dans l’esthétique baroque. En insistant sur la puissance et sur l’aura infernale de son héroïne, l’auteur du Cid fait du récit de sa vengeance une forme d’apothéose du mal.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

Elle côtoie en secret un amant plus âgé qui lui offre avec discrétion tout le luxe dont elle rêve ; ainsi que ce nouvel arrivant, le jeune poète René Vincy, qui, pour la première fois de sa vie, découvre l'amour passionnel. À la fois sage épouse, amante capricieuse, et amoureuse chaste, Suzanne découvre l'amour sous toutes formes... Paul Bourget érige là un chef-d'œuvre du roman d'analyse psychologique. Il y examine avec minutie les bouleversements que causent les passions, ainsi que toutes les facettes d'un des sentiments les plus complexes en littérature : l'amour. Poète, romancier et critique, Paul Bourget (1852-1935) a grandement influencé la littérature et les lettres françaises. Issu d’Ardèche, il grandit en Auvergne qui l’inspirera pour quelques romans. Dès ses premiers pas dans les salons littéraires et au « Vilains Bonshommes », il rencontre Paul Verlaine, Théodore de Banville, Stéphane Mallarmé, Albert Mérat, Arthur Rimbaud, ainsi qu’André Gill. D’abord tenté par le roman d’analyse expérimental, ses premiers romans « Cruelle énigme » (1885), « Un crime d'amour » (1886) et « Mensonges » (1887) sont un succès. À compter de « Le Disciple », son œuvre majeure, Paul Bourget s’oriente vers le roman à thèse — d’idées. Il analyse désormais les causes et l’origine en plus des mœurs. Il publie par la suite des romans psychologiques « L'Etape » (1902), « Un divorce » (1904) et « Le Démon de midi » (1914). Sujet à un bouleversement intérieur, Paul Bourget se convertit au catholicisme, et tente dès lors une synthèse entre la science et la foi.</p>"

Dans ce livre, Paul Bourget, en parlant d'un de ses personnages dont le souhait le plus cher est d'être écrivain, nuança au cours d'un de ses portraits l'image somme toute trop romantique ou trop naïve de l'artiste. A ce moment là de la nouvelle, il annonce la décision d'Eugène Corbières de se diriger vers une carrière de médecin : \"Ce qui m'a décidé à prendre cette voie, cela peut te sembler singulier, c'est le besoin de certitude. Mon goût personnel m'eût entraîné vers des études plus abstraites. Je serais entré à l'Ecole normale, pour m'occuper de la métaphysique, si je n'avais pas lu Kant et aussi L'Intelligence de Taine.

Et lorsque vous aurez lu ce beau livre, vous vous demanderez : pourquoi ?... Cette écrivaine russe n'était pourtant pas une inconnue. C'est elle qui ouvrit le deuxième congrès des écrivains de l'U.R.S.S, en décembre 1954, en tant que doyenne des romanciers soviétiques (50 ans d'activité littéraire). Le présent roman fut réédité près de vingt fois, dans les trente ans qui suivirent sa parution en 1923. Notre espoir est que la présente édition permettra de (re)découvrir cet auteur, de lui (re)donner une petite place dans le panthéon littéraire. Nous sommes en Russie, en 1923, et un vieillard nous conte son histoire : il va nous révéler son effroyable secret. Dans une très belle prose il nous fait vivre le long et odieux chemin de sa trahison... Il nous entraîne dans les salons frivoles des années 1860, ces salons plein d'esprit et de légèreté, en apparence... Car le drame couve : Serguéi Roussanine dénonce Mikhaïl Beidéman son camarade de l'école militaire, accusé d'idées révolutionnaires, parce qu'ils aiment la même femme, Vera. C'était le temps où «les araignées du régime tsariste suçaient le sang du prolétariat», où les révolutionnaires, les progressistes terminaient leurs vies «Vêtus de Pierre», incarcérés. Incarcération de Mikhaïl mais aussi de Véra et de Serguéi, le narrateur. Serguéi, un vieillard enfermé dans ses remords et libéré par sa folie... Une étonnante histoire décrivant avec justesse les recoins les plus cachés de l'âme humaine, une peinture très réaliste des moeurs des différentes classes sociales de l'époque de Dostoïevski, et enfin une ode à tous ces jeunes révolutionnaires sacrifiés sur l'autel de leurs idéaux.</p>"

Prévenu par sa seconde fille, elle aussi convoitée par le coureur de jupon, don Sanche d'Ulloa jure de retrouver et de pourfendre de sa rapière le responsable de toute l'histoire... D'une plume flamboyante, Michel Zévaco fait revivre le mythe de « Don Juan » dans ce roman inoubliable où s'entremêlent Histoire et combats à l'épée. La suite dans « Le Roi amoureux ». Michel Zévaco (1860-1918) est un écrivain et journaliste né en Corse, connu pour ses romans feuilletons de cape et d'épée. Attiré par la littérature, il devient secrétaire de rédaction dans un journal révolutionnaire dirigé par Jules Roques. Il se fait rapidement connaître comme étant anarchiste. Suite à ses propos considérés par l’État comme virulents, il est condamné à la prison plusieurs fois dans sa carrière journalistique. En 1900 il devient écrivain à part entière. Il débute avec le roman-feuilleton « Borgia ! » publié dans le journal de Jean Jaurès, puis devient feuilletoniste attitré de « Le Matin » aux côtés de « Gaston Leroux », dans lequel il publie ses romans les plus populaires dont « Le Capitan » et la série des « Pardaillan ».</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

    "sellerText": "<p>Vers la fin du règne de Louis XIV, quatre aristocrates s’enferment dans un château avec quarante-deux victimes soumises corps et âmes à leur pouvoir absolu. Première grande œuvre du marquis de Sade, sulfureuse et sans compromis, « Les 120 Journées de Sodome » fait l’inventaire exhaustif de six cents perversions assouvies en toute impunité, jusqu’aux plus extrêmes – où la plupart des victimes périssent dans d’épouvantables tourments – révélant avec un inimitable génie la face noire et inavouable de l’auteur. Sa version, écrite en 1785 à la prison de la Bastille sur un rouleau (caché, volé, disputé), reste inachevée, l’auteur l’ayant perdue en 1789. Elle est aujourd’hui classée trésor national. LUST Classics est une collection de classiques de la littérature érotique. Les œuvres qui la composent ont été sélectionnées en raison de leur apport historique majeur au genre et ce malgré des contenus parfois susceptibles de choquer et d’être polémiques. Donatien Alphonse François de Sade (1740-1814) est un romancier français dont l’écriture est caractérisée par une liberté et une audace sans doute jamais atteintes dans le reste de la littérature. Son nom est passé à la postérité en 1834 sous le néologisme « sadisme », qui fait référence aux actes de cruauté décrits dans ses œuvres. Interdites et diabolisées pendant tout le XIXe siècle, elles relatent des fantasmes sexuels sans limites. Son goût pour la luxure poussée à l’extrême lui vaudra un total de vingt-sept années en prison ou en asile pour « débauche outrée ».</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

Les sapins lui font une garde d’honneur. Belle, mais pauvre. Dieu qui la créa, pour la mieux garder, la fit solitaire. Il l’entoura de murs, il lui fit des créneaux ; et pour tout joyau, comme pour toute parure, il lui donna les neiges, les forêts et les eaux. Et pour qu’aucun ne lui portât envie, il la fit sauvage, hérissée et abrupte ; et l’étranger qui passe ne voyant ni grasses prairies, ni riches moissons sur ce sol sablonneux, s’étonne qu’on puisse y vivre, et qu’on y vive heureux. Pourtant il la dota de sublimes harmonies. Avec un doux climat, il lui donna un ciel clair. Il éleva ses cimes par-dessus les nuages, et plus blanches que les ailes d’un ange, elles voient passer l’éclair et la tourmente. Il la couvrit de solitudes où coulent des ruisseaux tout blancs d’écume, et dans la paix des hauts alpages comme sur les roches dentelées, en été dès le matin, on entend les clochettes des troupeaux et les doux sons de la cornemuse. Et, quand le ciel au couchant s’embrase comme une flamme, que la plaine s’emplit d’ombre et que le jour s’éteint, – dans la vallée encore, avec le bruit des feuilles, avec le bruit des eaux, – une voix grave passe qui parle d’au-delà.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

Non, les seules jeunes personnes du monde oisif et élégant. Prévost n'en connaît pas d'autre. L'oisiveté lui semble être un élément essentiel de la qualité humaine et de l'emploi du temps des gens bien. L'oisiveté, c'est le cinq à sept, la possibilité pour les dames d'avoir leur \" jour \", pour les messieurs de s'y rendre, et, pour les (presque) jeunes filles de passer un discret moment chez une amie complaisante qui leur laisse la libre disposition d'une chambre. Une chambre ! Ah, qu'y font-elles ? C'est la seule question que pose M. Prévost pendant quatre cents pages. Jusqu'où vont-elles ? Qu'acceptent-elles ? Il faut le reconnaître, il y a de quoi bouleverser les jeunes viveurs d'il y a un siècle. Qu'on imagine la poupée interdite qu'était alors une jeune fille, serrée dans un corset, enveloppée de jupons, une modestie voilant son décolleté, l'usage dégageant ses épaules - le soir, l'été - et laissant s'échauffer les rêves au-dessus de la gorge, de ce sillon, de cette félicité, de cette attente, de cette offrande. Oui, jusqu'où vont-elles ? La société de 1900 - à mi-chemin entre la Fête impériale et les audaces à la Paul Morand - avait élevé la traque des pucelages par les hommes et leur défense farouche par les filles à la dignité de ballet impudique, de parade ritualisée et acharnée. Là aussi, comme dans un duel, on s'arrêtait au premier sang \".<br>François Nourissier de l'Académie Goncourt.</p>"

Tous les textes qui composent ce recueil sont marqués au sceau de la perfection. Que s'y passe-t-il? Pas grand-chose en apparence. Ce sont des instants de vie, des moments fugitifs, un incident dans le quotidien, une ride sur une eau calme. Prenons la nouvelle intitulée Sur la baie : C'est une journée très banale d'une famille comme les autres. L'homme part le matin à son travail. Sa jeune femme, épuisée par une récente maternité, se repose. La grand-mère s'occupe du bébé. Les autres enfants jouent. Prélude à quoi? À rien? Mais toute la vie est là : L'angoisse du mari qui sent que sa femme lui échappe. La terreur de la jeune femme à la seule pensée qu'il pourrait y avoir un autre enfant. La nostalgie de la grand-mère qui sent que sa vie touche à sa fin. C'est impalpable. C'est toute la vérité. C'est l'art sous sa forme la plus achevée.</p>"

Quand on en suit l’étroit chemin qui dispute le passage au Trient torrentueux, on a quelquefois l’impression de marcher entre deux murs, il est vrai, de rochers et de cimes. Le fait est pourtant que sur la gauche, en venant de Chamonix cette gorge est renflée à mi-côte par un haut plateau qui la domine et y surplombe dans presque toute sa longueur de plusieurs lieues. À part un bout de montée ou de descente à l’entrée ou à la sortie, il est presque entièrement plan et uni. C’est comme une large corniche entre les sommités et le fond de la gorge, où ses bords pendent souvent à pic. Isolée dans sa hauteur, et ainsi peu fréquentée, cette bande de terrain n’en est pas moins à elle seule tout un charmant petit pays. On l’appelle les Fins-Hauts, du nom de celui de ses villages qui en occupe à peu près le point central et culminant. Le chemin s’y promène de l’un à l’autre de ces hameaux parmi les prés, les bouquets d’érables et de mélèzes, les cascades de rocs éboulés, et franchit lestement, sur de petits ponts, ravins et ruisseaux.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

Victoire, la nouvelle bonne, a entendu la mère et la fille au moment où elles reconnaissaient l'assassin et, lorsqu'elle est interrogée, elle dénonce son patron. C'est l'ami de Laroque, Lucien de Noirville, qui se charge de sa défense. Au cours du procès, il est établi que Laroque, victime d'un contexte économique difficile, avait contracté des dettes importantes qu'il avait, après avoir épuisé toutes les autres ressources - y compris un emprunt à un financier privé -, décidé de rembourser grâce à des gains au jeu. Ces dettes sont bien réelles mais, en fait, Laroque ne peut rembourser ce prêteur parce qu'il a avancé une somme à son ancienne maîtresse, ce qu'il ne peut pas dévoiler sans divulguer le nom de cette femme, chose contraire à l'honneur. En cour d'assises, coup de théâtre : alors qu'il défend Laroque, l'avocat reçoit un pli lui expliquant qu'il est en train de défendre l'ancien amant de sa femme!

Le Roseau pensotant, c’est l’homme du XXe siècle, atteint d’une faiblesse du raisonnement, ou d’une fainéantise acceptable parce que la technologie a réduit considérablement les difficultés de survie. Il apporte encore quelques lumières sur des faits simples de l’existence, après avoir constaté dans les brasseries et les cafés, dans sa classe ou dans la rue, que les connaissances de base, les notions les plus élémentaires étaient méconnues ou battues en brèche. Il pensote donc. Les temps héroïques de la grande pensée sont révolus. « Le Roseau pensotant, c’est moi », dit Roorda, non sans ironie. Diffusées dans les journaux de Lausanne, ses chroniques lui valurent une grande notoriété d’esprit.

Si la France ne daigne pas intervenir, ou si les colons ne se rendent pas aux plus simples calculs de la prévoyance, on peut prédire la ruine et l’abandon prochains de cette perle des mers que les anciens navigateurs saluèrent du nom d’Eden, et qui, épuisée et mutilée par la main de l’homme, secouera son joug et rentrera dans le domaine de Dieu. » G.S.

Ces textes, où s’expriment son amour profond de la nature et son souci de la préserver, révèlent une pensée étonnamment moderne, voire prémonitoire.

    "sellerText": "<p>Au XIXème siècle, le Chourineur, un ancien boucher envoyé dans une ferme en Algérie par Rodolphe, revient à Paris. Son fidèle ami Rodolphe lui manque, et il éprouve le même besoin que lui: lutter contre les injustices dans la capitale. Ensemble, ils préparent le sauvetage de François-Germain, l'homme pour qui Rodolphe a entrepris tant d'aventures... «Les Mystères de Paris» est un roman social d'aventures populaire, paru en feuilleton de 1842 à 1843. Comme Hugo dans «Les Misérables», Eugène Sue abat le tabou de la misère, et révèle les mœurs violentes et les bas-fonds de la société. Enfin l'on raconte l'histoire du peuple, tel qu'il est. Avec «Les mystères de Paris» Eugène Sue a établi un genre, le feuilleton, et créé une série au succès sans précédent ; un classique incontournable. Eugène Sue (1804-1857) est un écrivain français, élevé dans la richesse de la garde de Napoléon Ier. Enfant, c’est un élève turbulent qui, malgré une famille de chirurgiens à l’hôpital de la maison du roi, souhaite démissionner de ses obligations pour devenir Dandy. Son père meurt alors qu’il n’a que 28 ans, lui léguant une fortune considérable. Eugène Sue en profite, et dépense en seulement sept ans tout l’argent.

Elle contemple le monde depuis sa fenêtre et essaye d'apaiser les crises de Jeanne, maladive depuis la naissance. Lorsque son voisin le docteur Deberbe vient au secours de sa fille, la vie d'Hélène jusqu'alors monotone est bouleversée. Une folle passion pour le docteur lui fait tourner une page d'ennui — au prix de sa fille. Huitième volet de la série des « Rougon-Macquart », « Une Page d'Amour » met avant la violence psychologique. Sous le regard de la ville, Jeanne souffre de l'égoïsme des grandes personnes, et Hélène du manque d'amour. Émile Zola (1840-1902) est un écrivain considéré comme le plus lu et traduit du monde. Fils d’un ingénieur, il passe sa jeunesse à Aix-en-Provence. Son père meurt alors que Zola n’a que sept ans. Sa mère est en difficulté financière, et Zola est privé d’études. Il échoue deux fois le bac de français, et cherche du travail pour pallier au problème d’argent. Il obtient un poste de commis chez Hachette après une série de métiers déplaisants. Zola grimpe les échelons et devient en 1860 responsable de la publicité au sein d’Hachette. Grâce à cette situation, il se noue d’amitié avec des écrivains contemporains (Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet, Huysmans, Maupassant...) En 1867, il publie «Thérèse Raquin», un roman naturaliste qui fait scandale dans la presse. Cependant, il continue sur sa lancée et publie une grande quantité de romans naturalistes, avec entre autres les «Rougon-Macquart». Il s’impose ainsi en maître du naturalisme littéraire. À compter de la publication de «l'Assommoir», ses publications prennent de l’ampleur au sein du monde littéraire. Alors qu’il s’achète une villa à Médan, il publie avec Guy de Maupassant, J.-K. Huysmans, Henry Céard, Léon Hennique et Paul Alexis «Les Soirées de Médan». Zola est aussi connu pour avoir lutter contre l’antisémitisme: Le 13 janvier 1898, il publie une lettre ouverte dans le journal l'Aurore de Georges Clemenceau, intitulée «J'accuse...!»</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

    "sellerText": "<p>Les Aventures d'Arthur Gordon Pym de Nantucket (Edition Intégrale - Version Entièrement Illustrée) * Inclus une courte biographie d'Edgar Allan Poe Descriptif : Les Aventures d'Arthur Gordon Pym de Nantucket comprenant les détails d'une révolte et d'un affreux massacre à bord du brick américain le Grampus, faisant route vers les mers du Sud, en juin 1827 ; plus, l'histoire de la reprise du navire par les survivants ; leur naufrage et leurs horribles souffrances par suite de la famine ; leur délivrance par la goélette anglaise la Jane Guy ; courte exploration de ce navire dans l'océan Antarctique ; prise de la goélette et massacre de l'équipage dans un groupe d'îles au quatre-vingt-quatrième parallèle de latitude sud ; conjointement, les incroyables aventures et découvertes dans l'extrême sud, dont ce déplorable désastre a été l'origine. Ce roman publié en 1838 est présenté par Pym lui-même comme sa propre histoire qu'Edgar Poe raconte en son nom, à la première personne et, très vite, autre marque d'authenticité, le récit fait place à une sorte de journal de bord. Mais ces effets de réel n'atténuent rien de l'étrangeté des événements et des lieux où se trouve entraîné le lecteur : tout au contraire, le fascinant pouvoir du livre tient à la profondeur de cet imaginaire donné pour réel, et Borges, non sans raison, considérait ces Aventures comme le chef-d'œuvre de l'auteur. Extrait : En toute histoire de simple dommage ou danger, nous ne pouvons tirer de conclusions certaines, pour ou contre, même des données les plus simples. On supposera peut-être qu'une catastrophe comme celle que je viens de raconter devait refroidir efficacement ma passion naissante pour la mer. Tout au contraire, je n'éprouvai jamais un si ardent désir de connaître les étranges aventures qui accidentent la vie d'un navigateur qu'une semaine après notre miraculeuse délivrance. Ce court espace de temps suffit amplement pour effacer de ma mémoire les parties ténébreuses, et pour amener en pleine lumière toutes les touches de couleur délicieusement excitantes, tout le côté pittoresque de notre périlleux accident.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

    "sellerText": "<p>«Un caprice dans la manière de Jacques Callot» - 1820 - Préface de Stefan Zweig Le caprice (capriccio en italien) désigne à l'origine une forme picturale créée en 1617 par Jacques Callot pour Cosme II de Médicis, qu'il intitule Capriccii di varie figure: elle représente des éléments architecturaux disposés de manière très libre et fantaisiste. Le terme est également courant en musique pour évoquer une série d'improvisations et dans la critique littéraire pour exprimer la liberté prise par l'écrivain humoristique. Le roman se déroule à Rome au XVIIIe siècle pendant le carnaval, moment où l'ordre est temporairement suspendu et où les identités se confondent sous les masques. Dans le premier chapitre, Giglio Fava, un médiocre comédien, joue le rôle du prince Taer dans la pièce de Gozzi, Le Monstre turquin, et raconte un rêve dans lequel une princesse lui déclarait sa flamme. Sa fiancée, cependant, Giacinta Soarti, une jolie couturière, se lamente sur sa pauvreté, alors qu'elle est en train de mettre la main à une robe magnifique destinée à un client inconnu. Obsédés l'un et l'autre par des rêves romantiques, leur vive imagination les amène à confondre leurs fantaisies avec la réalité. Ils en viennent ainsi à assumer une seconde vie, sous la forme de la princesse Brambilla et de son amant le prince assyrien Cornelio Chiapperi, aidés en cela par la magie du charlatan Celionati, qui donne en outre à Giglio une leçon de comédie, corrigeant son jeu pompeux et déclamatoire, que sa vanité l'empêchait de voir. Sous son influence, de même, Giglio et Giacinta s'éprennent respectivement de la princesse Brambilla et du prince assyrien Cornelio..</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

Pour combler l’ennui, il promet à son maître de lui raconter ses aventures amoureuses. Sans cesse interrompu par les incidents du voyage et les nouvelles rencontres, Jacques prouve à maintes reprises, par son ingéniosité teintée de fatalisme, qu'il est le maître de son maître... Monument de la littérature française, « Jacques le Fataliste » influencera toutes le générations à venir et demeure aujourd'hui l'œuvre la plus commentée. Tel un « Don Quichotte » philosophique, ce roman est une aventure drôle et cocasse où le valet prend l'ascendant sur le maître. De narrateurs en narrateurs, Denis Diderot y livre ses idées sur la liberté et le déterminisme. Denis Diderot (1713-1784) est un écrivain et philosophe des lumières. Il laissera son empreinte dans tous les genres littéraires. D’abord ami de Rousseau puis d’Alembert, il supervise la rédaction d'un des ouvrages les plus marquants de son siècle, la célèbre « Encyclopédie ». Au théâtre, il pose les bases du drame bourgeois ; il révolutionne le roman et le conte avec « Jacques le fataliste et son maître » ; et invente la critique avec les « Salons ».</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

    "sellerText": "<p>Le thème dominant de ce recueil est l'incompréhension entre les humains, au travers d'une peinture de la société russe avec ses idées toutes faites, ses préjugés, ses rigidités. «Une banale histoire» : Un professeur de médecine, reconnu et absorbé par son métier, analyse ses relations avec sa femme et ses enfants. Il n'y trouve pas de grandes satisfactions. Il se sent réduit à ses titres et à son grade qui le limitent à des relations de hiérarchie dans son métier ou à des apparences dans la vie sociale, sans lui donner les moyens de changer les choses... «Le voyageur de 1re classe» est un ingénieur qui se désole d'être moins reconnu que les vedettes de variété, les brigands.. Dans «La Linotte», un professeur de médecine plein d'avenir épouse une femme qui se plaît dans les milieux artistes. La lune de miel ne dure guère. Cette femme ne commencera à prendre conscience de l'importance de son mari que lorsque celui-ci meurt. «La Dame au petit chien» conte une aventure amoureuse entre un homme et une femme en villégiature à Yalta. Cela ne devrait être qu'une passade sans suite, mais quelque chose fait qu'il n'en est rien. C'est le contre-exemple du thème principal, ici le courant passe, sans qu'on sache comment ni pourquoi. «Anne au cou» : un vieil homme riche épouse une jeune fille pauvre. C'est une description des rapports de force dans le couple. Naturellement, la force est au début du côté du mari qui contrôle l'argent. Bientôt le rapport s'inverse. Mais ceci n'altère en rien le vide des relations entre l'homme et la femme. «Un Désagrément» est la description d'un hôpital, avec son médecin qui manque de moyens et qui se heurte au personnel sous sa responsabilité. L'infirmier boit, la sage-femme est souvent absente, les règles élémentaires d'hygiènes ne sont pas respectées. Quand le médecin gifle l'infirmier, l'art du pouvoir est de noyer le poisson, de tout laisser en place et de ne rien régler. «On ne cache pas un aiguille dans un sac» est une petite histoire sur le thème de savoir qui trompe qui. Est-ce le policier qui, incognito, sur l'information d'une lettre anonyme, veut surprendre un trafic? Est-ce le conducteur de la troïka qui, ingénument, raconte que tout le monde est au courant que le policier arrive? «Une fois par an», c'est le jour de fête d'une vieille princesse. Les invités sont attendus, personne ne vient. Le domestique en est réduit à payer un neveu de la princesse pour que celui-ci daigne se déplacer. «Volodia» est un lycéen sans réussite dans ses études. Il ressent ses premiers émois amoureux pour une amie de sa mère. Celle-ci se débarrasse de lui comme d'un gamin et en plaisante avec la mère. Volodia trouve finalement un revolver et se suicide.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

    "sellerText": "<p>Ces 26 récits, écrits entre 1882 et 1898, tournent essentiellement autour des relations homme-femme: riche héritière dépressive ou officier timide marqué par un baiser qui ne lui était pas destiné (Un cas..., Le Baiser), pièges tendus pour contraindre l’homme au mariage (Au bain, Raté, Journal d’un homme emporté). La tentation est bien grande (La Pharmacienne), surtout pour des moines (Sans titre), la vengeance du mari trompé n’est pas si simple (Le Vengeur, Une vengeance), et quand on pourrait être heureux, il y a toujours un empêchement (Le Méchant Garçon, En villégiature), surtout si on remonte... dans le mauvais train (Un homme heureux) ou que l’on est le cadavre dans une enquête policière rondement menée (L’Allumette suédoise). Avec humour, en variant les situations cocasses, avec gravité aussi, Tchékhov nous dit la difficulté de vivre et de partager le bonheur. «Tout l’univers, toute la vie lui parurent une farce absurde, sans but.» (Le Baiser)</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

Mais dans cette Italie de la fin du XVIIIe siècle, les parents de Vincenzo voient d'un mauvais œil ce début d'idylle, Elena n'étant pas l'héritière d'une grande famille. La mère de Vincenzo complote contre cette liaison avec l'aide de Schedoni, son confesseur. Un soir, tandis que Vincenzo va sous les fenêtres de la maison d'Elena, un mystérieux moine l'avertit des terribles conséquences qui suivront s'il continue à vouloir Elena. L'avertissement se révèle juste, Elena est enlevée et emportée dans un couvent...

Why was Anokhi in such a bad shape?</p><p>Read this heart wrenching story of a strong independent girl and courageous girl who risks her life to stand up against injustice.</p><h2><strong><u>Chapter 1 Preview</u></strong></h2><p>It is approximately 2.30 a.m. The darkness is as terrifying as a black hole, devouring every particle of the sky. The wind is blowing intensely to heighten the drama of the night. Crops are rustling against one other on the large field. And, it seems scarecrows are laughing wickedly in the middle of the farm.</p><p>&nbsp;Anokhi is limping helplessly through the fields in torn clothes, wimping in pain. Her blood is draining slowly. Her eyes are clotted, lips are cut and her face is smeared with blood from a head injury. Her thighs are badly bruised. The acid has severely burned her hands and partially, her face. The skin is peeling off at several places on her body due to the acid reaction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;She places one hand on her abdomen to apply pressure on the cut in order to stop the bleeding. Her breathing becomes strained as she walks across the fields, but she continues. She walks slowly, determined to reach the main road for help .</p><p>&nbsp;Just then, she notices two cars rushing down the road towards the farmhouse. She stays at ground level in the middle of the crops for a time. The cars came to a halt in front of the farmhouse. A few men come out and go into the farmhouse.</p><p>&nbsp;Anokhi starts walking briskly to get away from the farmhouse. Despite her pain, she limps with all her power towards the main road. Suddenly, there is an explosion.</p><p>&nbsp;BOOOOOM!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The farmhouse blows up and a massive fire erupts, levelling up like a mountain. She pauses for a moment to examine it. It is a magnificent orange fire mountain, with smoke reaching up in the sky. She smiles like a lioness and starts walking again with all her strength. Finally, she arrives at to the main road, but her destination is still far away. She needs to travel another few kilometres to reach the highway and find a vehicle to help her reach the hospital. She could barely walk at this point, but she doesn’t give up hope. She begins to drag her left foot to slide forward towards the roadway.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>There she is. Walking alone on the road, limping, covered in blood and with charred skin all over her body. Her vision is filled with images of pain, torment, and harassment. Her heart is filled with grief which is reflected on her face.</em></p><p>&nbsp;\"Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!\" she shouts with all her might to vent out her anger and frustration.</p><p>&nbsp;However, no one hears her heart-breaking cries. Heavy automobiles are speeding along the highway and there are far too many yellow lights blinking and honking. She pauses for a while to muster her strength before walking to the middle of the highway.</p><p>&nbsp;The driver applies the brakes, causing the tires to skid on the highway.</p><p>&nbsp;Suddenly, she looks up to see a large yellow light approaching her. Two headlights combined into one large light speeds towards her. In a jiffy, everything goes white.</p>"

Gregory is a woodsman; one of the few men willing to risk going into the wood year-round. Winters are harsh, and people always burn through wood faster than they think they will. So if Gregory doesn't go into the forest daily, the people of his village will freeze. No one else seems willing to take the risk.</p><p>One morning, Gregory thinks he hears an elk nearby and thinks he'll bring home fresh meat for the village. Instead, he accidentally wounds the horse of a passing knight. A knight determined to bring Gregory to justice.</p><p>But when Gregory and the knight tangle in this haunted forest, they run into one of the things that go bump in the night, a source of local legends and tales that keep children shivering in their beds. Suddenly, the long arm of the law doesn't seem quite as strong.</p><p><em>This is my first published short story. It started life as an assignment in a creative writing class, and I’ve worked on it for more than a year since then.

And still dressed in form-fitting black. It was Wednesday. The service had been on Tuesday, and Tess had given the office staff the day off to attend or mourn as they wished. But for Tess, today was another workday with deadlines. Of course, anyone else could take the day off. Tess knew she had to be there. Just to answer client questions. Because she knew they would ask. And they knew she would be there. And would get constant calls at home if she wasn’t. Madison Avenue isn’t known to be one ounce more polite than they needed to be. Another sigh for the old times. Politer, more considerate times. Flyover country courtesies discarded in frantic-paced bicoastal cities.</p><p>Tess had pulled the keyboard across the ad-covered blotter to answer a certain client’s question. The one that Judy would have answered. While most ads were on the server, Judy often got big clients emailing her specific details. In this case, the email had gone unanswered.</p><p>A knock on the frame of the open door to Judy’s office startled her. The aluminum frame rattled the Plexiglas, a holdover com the earlier occupants. Judy and Tess had the only two “real” offices there, the rest of the staff worked in the open floor in desks lined up like the old news agencies. Back in times when news was “real”.</p><p>A tall man stood there, in a rumpled light gray trench coat, opened in front. Hanging off his broad shoulders straightened a few of the creases. “I’m Detective Johnson with the NYPD. I’m sorry for your loss and hate to intrude. There are some questions I need to ask.”&nbsp; The typical fast clip and run-together sentences from living in a city that never slept.</p><p>Tess mused for a second that police detectives probably slept less than most. A glance at his rumpled gray trench coat seemed to confirm that. More like Columbo than Sam Spade.</p><p>“Come in Detective.” Tess rose to shake his hand, and motioned to a chair that wasn’t covered in either print samples, design layouts, or bouquets from well-wishers. “Sorry about the mess, we haven’t had time to tidy up since the funeral.”</p><p>“I completely understand. Again, I’m sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, her death raised some questions. And those brought me here.”</p><p>Tess sat. Like punctuation.

Judy was one of the part-owners of the firm, so got my questions about when and where she was at the time. She answered all my questions perfectly – a little too perfectly. But her honest smile won me over. The case went into dead files, as no body ever turned up or even real proof of a violent crime. We only started two weeks after the first report, as usual, so the leads were cold.</p><p>The next time we met was when her offices at that computer firm and also her apartment were ransacked. And she called me – from the card I'd given her months before. She wanted to officially inform the NYPD of the crime, but also wanted it wrapped up quietly. And again, that winning smile made me take her side. But her distraught face at her apartment also made me bend some department rules. She had no other place to go, and didn't want to tell anyone of what happened. It being a Friday, I let her have access to my apartment – while I took the couch – over that weekend. She spent most of that time repairing her apartment and installing security measures. Although she also made time for dinners each night with me.</p><p>I was able to help her by consulting and also helping to install some of the wiring. She had someone else bring in special electronics to monitor her rooms.</p><p>That is how I got that key. And my own set of passcodes to let myself in.</p><p>She knew from that weekend that I wouldn't go further than she wanted. And I knew I couldn't go any further than she would let me.

And so did my poker face.</p><p>Inside, I'd lost a true friend, and a true love as well – even though I hadn't told her.</p><p>She probably knew, though. From the long kisses we shared.</p><p>Yes it hurt me to find out she had faked her death. But I had an inkling of what she was into from that office break-in, so she was probably keeping everyone nearest to her safe in the only way she knew how.</p><p>At least that's what I told myself.</p><p>Another bump showed me the reminder for the cheek-chewing was real.

But as you can see, it was never identical. Jude had black hair and I had blond. And our Da told us that we were more alike than not, otherwise. We liked to drink our milk and smile and gurgle. And neither of us cried much.</p><p>But we didn’t know our Ma much, well not at first. She caught a fever a few days after we were born and died soon after. Da was upset by this, but he often told us that our smiles and gurgles took all the pain away. That, and when he went out to hunt that night, he found a white and black spotted milk goat who had wandered off into the woods and was following him around as he tried to hunt. Her udders were full, and looked tight and painful to Da. So he took the goat home to us, so we could have some milk until he could find where she had wandered off from.</p><p>It was that night where we saw our Ma again. She was smiling at us, and we smiled back. Da couldn’t see her, so he didn’t understand why we were so happy. But with full bellies, we went to sleep and Da milked the rest from that goat and put the milk into skins to make into cheese. Then he tethered the goat right outside the hut to graze.</p><p>He never did find out who that goat belonged to. No farm around us was missing any. And we had that goat until we could eat solid food, Da said. And then it wandered off again one day. But it wasn’t the last time both tame and wild life around our cabin would take care of us.</p><p>We grew like sprouts, Da told us. Soon we were walking and getting into trouble. When he went off to hunt food for us to eat, he soon devised a system of tying us to opposite corners of the cabin, just long enough to not get us tangled with each other or anything else. Everything up and out of our reach, and secured so it couldn’t fall on us.</p><p>What he didn’t know is that the mice and birds would come to entertain us while he was gone. We would hear symphonies by the birds, and watch balancing and tumbling acts by the mice. And we knew Da was close when they would combine the most dramatic action with the trilling accompaniment of the birds. And when the door opened, the birds and mice would vanish, leaving us smiling and clapping just as Da opened the door with some game he had caught.</p><p>In those days, the land wasn’t owned by people, it was all property of the King or Queen or Prince, depending on who was in power when. And where the land was deeded to a local count or baron, the property title could be withdrawn at any time.</p><p>People were property of the land. And were supposed to stay with it. Our family, our Da and Ma, were from two different deeds. That meant that both sides wanted both of them, or would be just as happy to split them up so they could re-mate to somone else within the land deed they belonged to.</p><p>When Ma found she was pregnant, that made the problem very serious. You can’t split a child. And of course, Da and Ma loved each other very much. As short as life was in those days, a broken heart would make the end come that much quicker...</p><p><strong>Get Your Copy Now.</strong></p>"

Men lived about 40 years at most, and were working full time on their parents farm since they could walk and carry something. Children started out in the garden, but were managing the livestock and responsible for its care usually when they could no longer walk under its belly without ducking.</p><p>So they married earlier, and lived shorter. There were so many diseases around and no hospitals or trained doctors anywhere. The quacks usually lived in bigger cities. Villages often went without, and more often used the services of an 'old wise woman' for various ailments.</p><p>And the superstitions ran rampant.</p><p>Bullies then were a lot more violent than now.</p><p>Now, Sal and I were surprised almost daily for the first couple of months there. Just because our forest-upbringing had the law of fang and claw, but it was rather mild compared to tormenting and tortures that went on in “civilized society”.</p><p>Both my sister and I counted our blessings daily as we were under the Parish Priest and his wife's care. And we were careful to make sure we didn't do anything to upset them. Even accidentally.</p><p>That said, they weren't one to “spare the rod” if it was actually needed. And I got more of that end than did Sal – but then I was more adventurous.</p><p>We two might have been born with in minutes of each other, but we were wired completely different. She is and has always been a very kind, understanding, and had a definite set of standards for our behavior. I was always wondering why things were that way and would set up various “test-cases” to prove them one way or another.</p><p>And if it were proven wrong, I'd often be sitting carefully for a few days.</p><p>But that didn't deter me from working to understand things for what they were.</p><p>That's much different from what we had experienced in the forest. If we had a pet fawn, for instance, we had to make sure they weren't tame except to us. More than once, we'd come across what was left of one of our pets after a larger carnivore was done making them a meal.</p><p>And if we were lucky, the spirit of that former pet would hang around to say goodbye and cheer us up before they went on.</p><p>We couldn't hold the wolf or cougar at fault for it. Da would carefully explain how the law of the forest meant very exact things. And he'd wipe our tears and tell us to quit trying to make a pet out of everything we found. A few lessons like that, and we knew to respect the natural balance.</p><p>Humans could be the butt end of that balance, as we also learned.</p><p>And our own Ma had taught us a few things to keep us safe. She refereed to them as “talents”, while villager-gossips referred to them as “spells”.</p><p>Either way, being able to ward off something with claws and fangs who was four or five times heavier and faster than us – talents or spells kept us safe.</p><p>It took being around humans to find out what I really needed to survive...</p><p><strong>Get Your Copy Now.</strong></p><hr contenteditable=\"false\"><p><strong>Available from quality ebook outlets: &nbsp;</strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://books2read.com/u/m0lOpM\">https://books2read.com/u/m0lOpM</a></p>"

And I was drinking tea. Not that anyone minded. This place had more customers coming for their barbecued tenderloin sandwiches than their draft beer or hard liquor.</p><p>But the music, the atmosphere – that was pure Midwestern, traditional. Classic Western ballads in the jukebox. Broad shoulders on men, tight jeans on women. And smiles for everyone, but your hands are for your drink and your food. Lot's of self-respect around, which comes from respecting others first.</p><p>American values, passed on and validated with each new generation. And places like this dotted most of America and were more common than any corporate-run diners or coffee-houses. Because they were an outgrowth of the community, they weren't there to “make a lot of money”, although they did that, too.</p><p>This wasn't one of my usual haunts as a mystery writer. But this also wasn't one of my usual mysteries to solve.</p><p>I was relaxing at a table near the front. Waiting to meet someone – a certain someone who could help me with my problem. That situation was more than just an unresolved mystery. And if you know me, leaving some mystery unresolved in my life gets irritating. Like a single grain of sand inside a mussel's shell.</p><p>The front door opened and I recognized that young woman standing tall in its frame. She took a single stride in and stood there. With her heeled boots, she looked a long glass poured full of pure femininity. Her Timberline boots slipped into the tight pant-legs of her black leather jeans, which went on up to described every curve and dimple of her smooth legs beneath, from her knees right up to her hips, and to the very limit of those jeans' low-cut waist.</p><p>There, a thin band of ivory-white midriff took over before being itself covered by a snug, black and very defining knit v-top. An open black leather bolero jacket swept up from that midriff area to slide itself beneath a thick mane of wavy back hair. A cascade down her shoulders from its provocative part on one side of its crest.</p><p>Underneath those long tresses were dark brows, dark eyes, and dark lips that completed a goth approach to stunning beauty.</p><p>Those clear and piercing eyes swept the room, while almost everyone else's eyes swept over her.</p><p>She found me and strode over. A slight gesture from her hand and the conversations in the bar continued again. You could almost feel the disappointment of the single males from where I sat.</p><p>This young woman, like so many human counterparts, reveled in making a grand entrance.</p><p>As she came up to my table, I could smell wild rose and lilac from her hair, on top of the leather scent.</p><p>It was going to be one interesting afternoon...</p><p><strong>Anthology containing:</strong></p><ul><li><p>One More For the Road by J.

Its Observatory parking lot. All was almost pitched black outside the street lights and architectural lighting for the buildings. The moon was high in the sky, and the L. A. streets twinkled through their own lights as they stretched off toward the ocean. Behind us, the mountains were dark and nearly invisible in their gloom.</p><p>While we could hear the sirens and street traffic, there was none around us, and the parking lot was bare of cars.</p><p>“This isn’t just early morning, is it?” I asked.</p><p>“No,” Sal said. “This is two weeks before we were in your cabin. That moon was a sliver on the horizon when we left your place and now it’s nearly full, high in the sky.”</p><p>Jude added, “Different place, a different time. Now, watch.”</p><p>An apparition shifted from a fog-like mist on the west side of the parking lot to take a near-solid form. It looked solid, real. Except there was something unreal about it. Maybe it was the staring eyes and the fact that its feet walked through the parking curbs instead of stepping over them.</p><p>The straight line it was walking didn’t deviate. And it was coming straight toward us.</p><p>“So this is one of your ghosts you need to deal with?” I asked,</p><p>“One of them. Not our worst.” Sal replied.</p><p>“Worst is what? This one is darned spooky. It would keep most people wondering for months of nightmares,\"</p><p>“True enough. But there are ghosts who are far spookier, and more dangerous.”</p><p>The specter was a slight young girl, dressed in something out of the 50’s, it looked like. Sweater over a simple blouse. Full skirt below the knees, bobby-socks, and saddle-back black-and-white shoes. Her face was blank, her eyes focused on something beyond us.</p><p>She got closer and never saw us or slowed down. She kept going, walking right on through us. I flinched, but the girls didn’t.</p><p>I turned around to see her dissolve right through the front wall of the small tourist shop without slowing her pace.</p><p>Just then, Sal shouted, “Look out!”</p><p>I turned to look and there was some cosmic pinwheel-shaped rift in the sky. A few feet off the ground. Just where we had seen the girl appear.

Since he’d never married again, the idea of having a female moving about the big empty house made him both worried and content. He had been happy to live quietly at the end of a long, dusty road, but found his cleaning habits left too much dust around.</p><p>He wanted to write, not clean house. He didn’t want his solitude interrupted, but would appreciate having the dust gathered out of the corners and the occasional hot meal he didn’t have to prepare himself.</p><p>So he placed an ad through an agency. He paid them to find and pre-interview the applicants. They would send over one at a time, only sending the next in line when an earlier one disqualified themselves.</p><p>And the reasons for the disqualified applicants seemed inconsistent and even frivolous. But the company was only paid to send applicants, so the money would keep coming to them until Herman ran out of it, or they ran out of applicants. (Word can get around about certain ads…)</p><p>Maggie was herself quiet and happy to have such a job. She was a student of writing, but had never published. Her shyness found her many admirers, but never a long relationship. That’s not to say she didn’t have strong opinions. And perhaps those were what drove her would-be lovers away. She never talked about her personal life, even when asked.</p><p>How she got hired was a bit of a mystery. She wasn’t outspoken much, but was firm and unmovable when she was. It wasn’t that all things should be a certain way, but certain things should be kept in certain ways.</p><p>The hiring company took this minor loss of income in stride.</p><p>- - - -</p><p>Herman got used to the thick curtains on the west being open in the morning, and those curtains on the east only open when the sun had passed the house peak, where the west curtains would be closed. He didn’t mind that if he came in early from his walk, he wasn’t allowed back in his own study until the cleaning was finished.</p><p>Maggie didn’t work to keep the porch as spotless as the rest of the house inside. So when Herman was refused access to his inner chambers, while she was cleaning, he would come out here. He took the rough broom and ash shovel, and pick up the worst-offending dirt clods and dried mud clumps. He’d even pick up his boots to put them outside on the steps so that he could empty the tray they sat on. All to help get rid of som of the dust. At least those in the form of dirt clumps.</p><p>In Spring, he would find occasion to take his heavy tan overalls and dark brown coats to put them into a standalone, faded, porch cabinet out of the sun. Heavy gloves would go into porous bags made from pillowcases, putting in sets onto one of its upper shelves.</p><p>However, he wasn’t permitted to clean the windows or screens of that porch. Maggie would have a fit, in her own quiet way, if he tried this. If they needed painting or repairs, then he could take them down to work on them.</p><p>The house soon became Maggie’s as much as Herman’s, although he had title to it...</p><p><strong>Scroll Up and Get Your Copy Now.</strong></p>"

I didn't realize how hungry I'd gotten with all that walking.\"</p><p>And as I rounded the end of the mission style oak couch to turn toward where she sat, I was reminded of another hunger. While her legs were crossed, and her arms folded her chest, she wore nothing beneath.</p><p>My feet kept me from moving forward. At least I closed my mouth. But my eyes didn't know where to look, so they settled on her dark, almost bottomless eyes.</p><p>\"You don't know what to say – so male-geek of you. Oh – that's because you're embarrassed. Let me put on something to assuage those moral senses of yours.\"</p><p>One of her index fingers moved slightly and she was now clothed in flannel pajama's, in a tartan plaid of greens with brown and red highlights.</p><p>I still considered my options. And still couldn't think of anything to say that wasn't school-boy idiot-speak.</p><p>She moved her left arm and patted the brown leather cushion to that side of her. \"Come. Sit. I won't bite you – unless you want me to.\"</p><p>As I settled down, still a bit tense, I could smell her personal wild rose and Russian Olive fragrance, like the spring fence rows of the farm I was raised on. Quite different than the musty stacks of books I was just traveling through.</p><p>Gaia sat back, a slider in her own hand, munching daintily. \"You know, these really are good.\"</p><p>\"But why have you led me here?\"</p><p>\"Oh, something of interest to both of us.\"</p><p>\"Such as?\"</p><p>\"In two weeks, our world will end.

This place had more customers coming for their barbecued tenderloin sandwiches than their draft beer or hard liquor.</p><p>But the music, the atmosphere – that was pure Midwestern, traditional. Classic Western ballads in the jukebox. Broad shoulders on men, tight jeans on women. And smiles for everyone, but your hands are for your drink and your food. Lot's of self-respect around, which comes from respecting others first.</p><p>American values, passed on and validated with each new generation. And places like this dotted most of America and were more common than any corporate-run diners or coffee-houses. Because they were an outgrowth of the community, they weren't there to “make a lot of money”, although they did that, too.</p><p>This wasn't one of my usual haunts as a mystery writer. But this also wasn't one of my usual mysteries to solve.</p><p>I was relaxing at a table near the front. Waiting to meet someone – a certain someone who could help me with my problem. That situation was more than just an unresolved mystery. And if you know me, leaving some mystery unresolved in my life gets irritating. Like a single grain of sand inside a mussel's shell.</p><p>The front door opened and I recognized that young woman standing tall in its frame. She took a single stride in and stood there. With her heeled boots, she looked a long glass poured full of pure femininity. Her Timberline boots slipped into the tight pant-legs of her black leather jeans, which went on up to described every curve and dimple of her smooth legs beneath, from her knees right up to her hips, and to the very limit of those jeans' low-cut waist.</p><p>There, a thin band of ivory-white midriff took over before being itself covered by a snug, black and very defining knit v-top. An open black leather bolero jacket swept up from that midriff area to slide itself beneath a thick mane of wavy back hair. A cascade down her shoulders from its provocative part on one side of its crest.</p><p>Underneath those long tresses were dark brows, dark eyes, and dark lips that completed a goth approach to stunning beauty.</p><p>Those clear and piercing eyes swept the room, while almost everyone else's eyes swept over her.</p><p>She found me and strode over. A slight gesture from her hand and the conversations in the bar continued again. You could almost feel the disappointment of the single males from where I sat.</p><p>This young woman, like so many human counterparts, reveled in making a grand entrance.</p><p>As she came up to my table, I could smell wild rose and lilac from her hair, on top of the leather scent.</p><p>It was going to be one interesting afternoon...</p><p><strong>Scroll Up and Get Your Copy Now</strong></p>"

    "sellerText": "<p><strong>Evelyn E. Smith</strong> (25 July 1922 – 4 July 2000) was an American writer of science fiction and mysteries, as well as a compiler of crossword puzzles.</p><p>During the 1950s, under her own name, Smith regularly published short stories and novelettes in such publications as Galaxy Science Fiction, Fantastic Universe and the prestigious The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Her short fiction ranges from satires set in a post-apocalyptic setting such as \"The Last of the Spode\" and \"The Hardest Bargain\", to \"BAXBR/DAXBR\", where she explores the dangers of Martian crossword puzzles.</p><p><strong>Space Opera</strong> is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasizes space warfare, melodramatic adventure, interplanetary battles, chivalric romance, and risk-taking. Set mainly or entirely in outer space, it usually involves conflict between opponents possessing advanced abilities, futuristic weapons, and other sophisticated technology.</p><p>The term has no relation to music, as in a traditional opera, but is instead a play on the terms \"soap opera\", a melodramatic television series, and \"horse opera\", which was coined during the 1930s to indicate a formulaic Western movie. Space operas emerged in the 1930s and continue to be produced in literature, film, comics, television, and video games.</p><p><strong>The Golden Age of Pulp Magazine Fiction </strong>derives from pulp magazines (often referred to as \"the pulps\") as they were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the late 1950s. The term pulp derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called \"glossies\" or \"slicks\".</p><p>The pulps gave rise to the term pulp fiction. Pulps were the successors to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short-fiction magazines of the 19th century. Although many writers wrote for pulps, the magazines were proving grounds for those authors like Robert Heinlein, Louis LaMour, \"Max Brand\", Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, and many others. The best writers moved onto longer fiction required by paperback publishers. Many of these authors have never been out of print, even long after their passing.</p><p><strong>Anthology containing:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Most Sentimental Man</p></li><li><p>The Venus Trap</p></li><li><p>The Vilbar Party</p></li><li><p>My Fair Planet</p></li><li><p>Once a Greech</p></li><li><p>Collector's Item</p></li><li><p>Jack of No Trades</p></li><li><p>Tea Tray in the Sky</p></li><li><p>Not Fit for Children</p></li><li><p>Man's Best Friend</p></li><li><p>The Princess and the Physicist</p></li><li><p>The Man Outside</p></li><li><p>The Ignoble Savages</p></li><li><p>Sentry of the Sky</p></li><li><p>The Blue Tower</p></li><li><p>The Doorway</p></li></ul><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p>"

These are the workouts and comments between the Author and First Readers on the characters, scenes, conflicts, relationships, and general planning.

Without being too cryptic, I'll work to refer to the Book Universes Notes volumes above to ensure you have the needed background. Since the author has to keep all this fresh in my mind, I will often bounce these relationships around and tend to ask you what you think about planned books and character development.</p><p>These blog posts will only show up to Insiders Club Members, never on the general feed for the site.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Insiders are <u>truly</u> insiders.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote><h4>Notes:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li><p>As new books are released, the oldest books are retired. This includes pre-release book notes. I'll keep those release notes for your study, but after six months, they'll also be retired.

His work focused on socioeconomic speculation, usually expressed in thought-provoking explorations of utopian societies from a radical, sometime satiric perspective. He was a popular author from the 1950s to the 1970s, especially with readers of science fiction and fantasy magazines.</p><p>Reynolds was the first author to write an original novel based upon the 1966-1969 NBC television series Star Trek.</p><p><strong>Space Opera </strong>is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasizes space warfare, melodramatic adventure, interplanetary battles, chivalric romance, and risk-taking.

I am too famed as a lonesome man. I live alone in my world. And people are often confused about what is going on in Nachi's mind. In fact, 'What is going on in Nachi's mind?' is the hottest question in those minds that really don't care who or what 'Nachi' is. And it is, in fact, Nachi, who thinks that they are continuously thinking about him.</p><p>That is why I live in my own world. A cave. A shell. A little hut - away from eyes that pry and pry, and keep a vigil on my nonsense activities. Because some fear I might disrupt society. Some just want a good show. And some really care about my well-being.</p><p>But there is something in me, which loathes it when people care. I want to be so alone that not even their concern touches me. I want to be left inside a cave like Lazarus and never die, but never really live.</p><p>I am famous for being alone. But I don't want to be known. Not even for being alone. For when you are famous for being someone, you are really not. You are a mere puppet. Just another one of those possibilities which remain a possibility for life. And can only spark interest in people's minds - who are but an audience. I am a God. With Its invisible presence of being absent. An omnipresent absence I am.</p><p>And yet, there are parts of me which are not so antisocial. I want to be amongst people. And there are times when this yearning overtakes me - like an ocean overtaking a river and digging its grave. When I have not seen a face for ages, when I've not heard a voice, I fall into that extreme crowd of emptiness that rankles my insides like there's no end, and I begin to yearn for it - for what I keep myself away from. I seek the solitude of company all over again.</p><p>Then I go out. I lay myself at the feet of giggling faces and charming graces - like an old man in the company of his grandchildren, thinking and thinking, if he belongs to the new world or not?</p><p>I am not averse to normal things. Do not think I am an alien, even though sometimes I feel I am. I watch television regularly. I stare and stare into mobile screens, watching one episode of a drama after another - mashing potatoes, peeling packets of Maggi, thinking about a past in which I was always in search of company, but would shun it as it as soon as it appeared in my life. I do normal things. To give myself a sensation of being connected to the world, to people who run the world with their words, and acts - like fighting with each other in parliaments, and on Twitter, like many expertitutes selling their pseudo-professional opinions on everything under the sky, and even above it.</p><p>And sometimes I go out and hang around in restaurants, where kohl-smeared eyes and tucked in T-shirts play indecent games with me. They look at me with interest because I look like a writer (I am not) and want to talk with me about things they can never talk about with others. They want to share everything with me. Like their deepest fantasies and love of death. And of course, their desire to leave the world like me, and wander - like a stoic hermit, who has nothing to do with fleeting desires, because they are the surest way of 'being in the world', when all I seek is 'being out of it'.</p><p>I am a modern man. I do not live in the past, and especially not the future, because I already know what lays ahead - Death.</p><p>I love to travel. I tell no one where I am going, and take these solitary trips to places, and click photos of me - and me alone - with various backgrounds, lying to the travel companies that I am perfectly healthy, and I never show those pics to anyone. I have pics of mine in front of snow-clad mountains, and green foliage of a brown forest, and rivers sparkling with lively drops of rain, thrashing the mud like cities drowning to apocalypse. Images no one has ever seen.</p><p>And I have experienced so-called weird things. I have walked to the end of a road, which goes on and on, and then it stops and merges into a wood, or a set of farm fields. I sit there on a stone. And contemplate the emptiness of the end of the world - which is as empty as a bustling city is.</p><p>I have not seen everything. No. But I have seen a few things. Like the pins of a big stapler going into my stomach while I am on an operating table, holding in my scream, because the anaesthesia stopped working a minute ago, and even though I am awake, my lips totally cannot move.</p><p>I have watched the homeless wisps of clouds risking their lives by entering the window of a guest house with heaters and fires on. I have slept for two hours on the side of Arabian sea, one night, in Bombay, when out of sudden the waves struck me and woke me up and told me it was not the time for me merge with them. I've sat alone in a dilapidated restaurant in a lost village and face-blank lied to strangers stories of how I love the company of people; how I just love hanging out with them. And I have seen them - knowing that I am lying, and the respect they had for me, for lying so much. Only to protect my home - ME.</p><p>But I have said enough. Silence is the only thing there is - I once wrote. So I am going against the grain by talking so much. But my fingers won't stop. I am typing and typing. Creating a beautiful mountain of garbage of words that can speak about only but me - a Nothingness ('Nachi' after all means 'no consciousness') yearning to escape into nothingness - only enjoying solitary walks with himself, only lying to everyone that he is unhappy, when in fact he is the happiest person in the world. Because he lives in the best home possible - his own mind.</p><p>I 'am' my own heaven. My Eudaimonia.</p><p>---</p><p>With these words, I humbly present to you the much-awaited EUDAIMONIA ANTHOLOGY, which consists of such fantastic pieces that I can but be proud. I thank Som and Priyanka for their efforts in picking out the pieces from Innumerable entries we, analysing them, and making sure that they are In the best of shapes. I also thank Era for the Illustrations, which complement the pieces perfectly. And of course, and not the least, I thank Elisabeth for her editorial intervention, who did a wonderful job of copyediting every piece meticulously.</p><p>I would also like to thank a wonderful publication, Paper Poetry, with whom we have collaborated on this particular prompt, and the pieces that you see in the anthology are a mix from both - Us &amp; Them. So, thank you Suntonu Bhadra, Carolyn Hastings, and Indubala Kachhawa for all the help and kind co-operation throughout.</p><p>I also thank the Contributors - </p><p>Chris Mooney-Singh, who has amalgamated Eudaimonia by expressing it through nature, his pen vividly painting the gorgeousness. And who doesn't like nature and flowers?</p><p>Era Garg, whose poem \"Ambrosia\", creates such lively images that they dance right in front of us as readers. Punctuated by beautiful, beautiful artwork, I think this poem is all about the images, conjured. It's so lively and dances right in front of you.</p><p>Joseph Lieungh, who has written a very deep, expansive, and imaginative piece that is able to convey the feeling of the word too perfectly.</p><p>Pablo Pereyra, whose meditative essay on something like daily chores is so relatable. Also, it's a documentation of daily life during this harsher time, to which we all can relate.</p><p>Lee Ameka: Written from the point of view of a parent, it is so tender and so full of those little moments in life that you live to experience.</p><p>K. Barrett: A soul-satisfying piece. This poem captures the euphoria that a writer feels when the pen touches the paper.</p><p>Jonah Lightwhale: Shaped as a biography this poem is a poetic journey of dreams on the page.</p><p>Erika Burkhalter: Something meditative to reflect on. Also, the essence of Eudaimonia is amalgamated with spirituality in a quiet way.</p><p>Dean K Miller: The poem is about stillness and inner life. Our Inner life is visual in the words we write and that's what we see in this poem.</p><p>- Nachi Keta<br>Founder, ShabdAaweg Press<br>(A Unit of ShabdAaweg Foundation, which runs Literary Impulse)</p>"

In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called \"glossies\" or \"slicks\".</p><p>The pulps gave rise to the term pulp fiction. Pulps were the successors to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short-fiction magazines of the 19th century. Although many writers wrote for pulps, the magazines were proving grounds for those authors like Robert Heinlein, Louis LaMour, \"Max Brand\", Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, and many others. The best writers moved onto longer fiction required by paperback publishers. Many of these authors have never been out of print, even long after their passing.</p><p><strong>Anthology containing:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A Bad Town for Spacemen by Robert Scott</p></li><li><p>The Android Kill by John Jakes</p></li><li><p>Tony and the Beetles by Philip K.

Writing philosophical short stories to seize the wonder of life and empower others.</p><p>● Kim McKinney is from North Carolina and loves travel, hot air balloons, and a delightful story.</p><p>● Gayle Kurtzer-Meyers , avid freelancer with multiple industry awards on a kaleidoscope of topics. Editor and top writer status on Medium. Shining light to lift others on their dream journey.</p><p>● Aimée Gramblin, top writer on Medium, is a poet and essayist with a nature-inspired memoir forthcoming.</p><p>● Paroma Sen has been writing stories since she was a child. Technology marketingis how she earns a living, but she reserves a part of her heart for poetry and shortstories. She's a Top Writer for poetry on Medium.</p><p>● Rebecca is a researcher exploring the evolution of sociality and cognition. She works with corvids in the UK. In her spare time we can usually find her writing poetry, sea-swimming or curling up on the sofa with a cup of tea and a book.</p><p>We like to think that it was a joyful experiment. We got some fantastic entries; we read them carefully, judged them together, felt like choosing all of them, but only seven we had planned.</p><p>We didn’t want to overdo. And we had to make some tough decisions. Only seven remained on paper, but in our hearts, all made a space.</p><p>We like to consider it an achievement.</p>"

Now, they must explore the harsh wastes of a dystopian world in order to uncover answers about the mystery of Leviathan, an ancient AI that has suddenly resurfaced. However, they're not the only ones interested in finding out these answers: An authoritarian one-world government, a sect of undercover rebels, and a deranged techno-cult are also on the hunt for the keys to the enigmatic AI. Not only that, but the Devil himself is likely to make an appearance.</p><p>Exploring themes of free will, ego death, and efficiency, Leviathan uncovers a brutal alternate future where the only rule of law is structure and logic. Felons of any kind are executed on the spot, and the new world order rules over every minuscule part of people's days. Actors and actresses have been replaced by \"Idols\", or androids that resemble real-world humans. And, perhaps worst of all, people can be hacked... and they are, at a steadily increasing rate.</p><p>Author Jacob Robinson first wrote Leviathan from 2015 to 2016, for which the manuscript was then put down for a few years. Sometime later in 2019, the book was finally finished and released to the public on June 1st, 2020. Jacob Robinson also writes for Apalla, as well as his own personal blog at jacob-robinson.com .</p><p>--</p><p>Did you know?

Aided by a friend, he continued writing and publishing science fiction and, later, fantasy, into his 80s.

That I knew from working with him over the past few months of my training at the Library.</p><p>Ben just nodded, and pulled out a small stack of books to hand them to me. Almost like he had spelled them out of thin air. And I wouldn’t put that past him.</p><p>I looked them over.</p><p>They were esoteric, of course. But seemed to deal with time travel and bending. Sure, there was his own treatise from what he’d learned after meeting Carol and Tess, our favorite time-benders. But a lot of “fiction” here as well. Which we all know from reading John’s books is that it’s just another way to write factual occurrences, but in a more entertaining format.</p><p>“What’s all this about, Ben?”</p><p>He only nodded and walked away to the center of the Library, where that long mission-style, brown leather couch sat, along with its matching coffee table and opposing side chairs.</p><p>So I took the hint and quit asking questions. Just sat down to start reading.</p><p>When I looked up again, it was just to see Granger’s smiling face as she set down a large plate of brownies next to a platter that held a carafe of steaming beverage with mugs. Which smelled like café-mocha – double chocolate for me this afternoon. Meant they needed me to concentrate and study quickly.</p><p>I looked up to thank Granger, but she had already disappeared into the surrounding library stacks.</p><p>I poured myself a mug-full, took a brownie in the other hand, then sat back, crossed my legs beneath that knee-length gold-sequined flapper outfit I loved, and considered what I’d read to that point.</p><p>All of these books had a commonality of time loops.</p><p>Not my particular area of expertise.</p><p>Of course, I was still digesting all I’d been studying for the last few months. Ever since I had decided to go ahead and get that Ghost Hunter training so I could help more people (both ghosts and corporeal) with solving their mysteries.</p><p>And that meant I’d get to meet John occasionally for debriefing. Always a joy, with those rugged good looks of his…</p><p>I had to shake my head to get back to concentrating on what this mission was. Another brownie helped.</p><p>Then I saw the folder that I’d missed before – or someone had shifted it in under those books while I was engulfed in my reading.</p><p>It opened simply. My first mission.</p><p>First my heart went a-pattering, then it sank.</p><p>This one was do – or die.</p><p>A funny thing to say to a spirit-guide. Funny in a tragic sense.</p><p>Things had been happening that weren’t good. Our own staff gone missing. Cases being un-solved. The Library missing materials – whole shelves-full at once.</p><p>Then I saw the one picture that almost made my own heart stop.</p><p>It was a picture of my old ship, the U.S.S. Sea Quest. But the caption said it was taken just before that ship was towed to salvage.</p><p>And that date was before John, Sal, and Jude ever came to rescue me.</p><p>Meaning: I’d never become a spirit guide, gotten this training, joined the Ghost Hunters – and was probably now doomed to haunt a salvage yard as a ghost.</p><p>I closed the folder with a slap. Angry – just a bit.</p><p>No. I wasn’t going out that way.</p><p>I slipped my hand in without opening that folder again, and tore the top sheet off the inside cover.</p><p>That was the mission statement. And I read it closely.</p><p>Then looked up.</p><p>Someone familiar was phasing into place in front of me…</p><p><strong>Get Your Copy Now.</strong></p>"

It is lovely and not something I usually read which is why it is nice to be given the opportunity.</p><p>It really is a gorgeous little story (and I know there is more to come). The descriptive details of the village and inhabitants is great and one can really imagine life there. I quite liked the gang related connections and wonder what is going on there. I expect there will be more to come</p><p>Anyway it is a lovely story, well written and descriptive.\" - Adrienne N.</p><p>\"The best thing about being on Twitter has been discovering new authors. I also love the humor, but good books &gt; funny .gifs.</p><p>I’ll do another post with the (long) list of fine writers and their books I’ve discovered there, but today we focus on one delightful little book (or Part I of a delightful long book) Te Kererū by Susan G. Smith.</p><h4>The book subtly hints Kate's something more than what she seems… something bigger…</h4><p>“Te Kererū” is the Māori name for the native New Zealand wood pigeon, a beautiful and tasty bird. When three-year-old Katherine Taylor, a “Pākehā” (white person) is orphaned by a massive landslide, she is adopted by the regional Māori chief–and by the village and its people. Given the nickname Te Kererū, little Kate is different, quiet, mysterious, apparently the proverbial “old soul.” But the book subtly hints she’s something more than this, something bigger…</p><p>Without trying hard in any way, we’re educated about the New Zealand Māori culture and society, something I had only a slight knowledge of before reading Te Kererū. The author obviously loves her country and its people and the book opened up a new piece of the world for me, as I believe it will for most readers.</p><p>Her style is clear, limpid is the old-fashioned word, mostly short declarative sentences, but skillfully layered one upon another, sips not gulps, and very satisfying, in the long run.</p><p>The story is developed through a series of scenes or vignettes, glimpses of events and pieces of conversations, a technique I also use and can appreciate. Each chapter is a facet of a gem, and gradually we begin to see something taking shape, a mission or a destiny, and…end of Book 1.</p><p>Like the wonderful old movie serials, the present volume leaves the reader wanting more. This isn’t so common these days, but I’m all right with it. I understand the next book will be available soon, which I hope is true.</p><p>Because the only thing I didn’t like about this book was that it ended.\" - <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://neovictorian23.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/te-kereru-book-1-the-nest-by-susan-smith/\">Neovictorian</a></p>"

No matter if it's in distant history, in a foreign land, across town, or down the street.</p><p>These pandemics and plagues are occurring with more frequency, probably due to our population areas being thick and numerous with so many people. One advantage this has is in the higher quality of medical care. And the many universities and medical centers who are constantly at work on how to improve that health quality.</p><p>Our concerns with our health are also reflected in our own fiction works.</p><p>As bad as the news is about pandemics and plagues, our fiction works have already explored these outcomes and more. But at least they are there for our entertainment only. No one ever takes them seriously.</p><p>So that's the point of this small omnibus. A selection of stories to help you through your own healthy days and those where you may need to isolate yourself or even self-quarantine. Days where you have to use social distancing until you know your illness can't be spread to your friends and family and associates.</p><p>Entertainment is useful in times like these. Distractions from the noise, fears, and panic attacks some encounter. And maybe a way to prepare yourself for the worse - while hoping those days never come.</p><p>You'll find some classics here, and stories by classic authors you may not have read, as well as authors and stories completely new to you, even if old in time.</p><p>And even if you are picking this up when the skies are blue and all the world is running fine, and everyone you know is completely healthy - then take some time to enjoy a break in your routine, to explore different worlds and live through their eyes and feelings.</p><p>These stories were written about the survivors. Some are gruesome, some just unsettling. While its said that fiction is used to educate as well as entertain - here's hoping your choices in \"real life\" are less deadly than the one's you read about here...</p><h4>This omnibus contains:</h4><p>- The Case of the Forever Cure by C.

One that could heal or kill.</h3><p>That was why I'd left two families behind me on that road.</p><p>One who raised me, but I'd left behind to find answers to questions they couldn't answer. They didn't know where I was now.</p><p>Another which I'd felt could be my home, but their neighbors said I had to leave.</p><p>So now I was walking down this abandoned desert highway, looking at an uncertain future.</p><p>I could only blame myself. And blame my past.</p><p>Because how my secret worked depended what I thought and felt.</p><p>But until I could get a grip on what raged inside me, I didn't feel safe around anyone. Not safe for them, anyway.</p><p>And so I walked.</p><p><br class=\"ProseMirror-trailingBreak\"></p><h4>Excerpt:</h4><p>I waited until we'd finished shutting everything down for the day before I started asking my Mom questions.</p><p>Of course, the coffee pot and anything electric got shut off, the gas to the grill, and all the dishes washed and put away. That's a lot of alone time, and dish washing goes faster with two people if you work fast and quiet. Gather, wash, rinse, put away. Leapfrogging the stations. Because the faster you get the chores done, the more time you have for stuff you want to do – like talking.</p><p>I know it wasn't “adult-like” but I still liked holding my parents hands, and I felt they liked it to – more than they knew.</p><p>“Mom, do you get many new memories of your life before?”</p><p>“Oh, sometimes. Dreams, sure, but those aren't accurate. And then when I'm doing something, I can get snatches of memories back.”</p><p>“Did you ever get dreams or memories of your real mom?”</p><p>“Only that she always seemed to be smiling at me. From what I understand, she wasn't around very long. So if all I ever remember of her was a smiling face, then that will be good.”</p><p>“You never met your real dad?”</p><p>She shook her head no. “From what I understand, he wasn't around since before I was born.”</p><p>“And your step-dad?”</p><p>She shrugged. “He had his problems. And worked long hours, then would be in town drinking somewhere into the evening. I remember him smiling some, but that was with my mom. After that, I didn't see him much. And Mrs. Tate was my kinda substitute mom after that.”</p><p>“But she wasn't real.”</p><p>Mom stopped and looked at me. “That's not correct. She was very real when I was younger. Always positive. Always helpful. And would listen to me and help me when she could. At least that's what I remember.”</p><p>“But you said she turned out to be a ghost?”</p><p>We started walking toward home again. “Yes, but I like to think of her as a spirit-guide. More like the Amerindian legends.”</p><p>We were silent for a few paces.</p><p>“Rochelle, Arthur told me you'd been asking about your own mom.”</p><p>I nodded. “Sure. I was thinking about going to find if she had any other family.”</p><p>Mom looked over at me to see my expression for a bit as we approached our home. “I think you might be able to visit them...”</p><p>I stopped and looked at her eyes. “And not kill them?”</p><p>She just nodded, with sad eyes. “But of course, they can't know – “</p><p>“That I'm a Lazurai?”</p><h4>Scroll Up and Get Your Copy Now.</h4>"

Or did he? It was a dream, after all.</p><p>The next day he meets two women who visit his cabin, arriving out of the blue, literally. (Well, one arrived with pitched black darkness which filled his cabin and made her cough.)</p><p>These two have an offer for Stark. All he really wanted was to enjoy the small cabin and solitude so he could write his detective stories.</p><p>These ladies had another offer - to help them solve the reasons ghosts don't move on. Plenty of new inspiration for stories, decent pay, won't interrupt his writing schedule.</p><p><em>Of course, he could die doing it...</em></p><h4>Excerpt:</h4><p>When the shimmering cleared, we were in Griffith Park, Los Angeles. Its Observatory parking lot. All was almost pitched black outside the street lights and architectural lighting for the buildings. The moon was high in the sky, and the L. A. streets twinkled through their own lights as they stretched off toward the ocean. Behind us, the mountains were dark and nearly invisible in their gloom.</p><p>While we could hear the sirens and street traffic, there was none around us, and the parking lot was bare of cars.</p><p>“This isn’t just early morning, is it?” I asked.</p><p>“No,” Sal said. “This is two weeks before we were in your cabin. That moon was a sliver on the horizon when we left your place and now it’s nearly full, high in the sky.”</p><p>Jude added, “Different place, a different time. Now, watch.”</p><p>An apparition shifted from a fog-like mist on the west side of the parking lot to take a near-solid form. It looked solid, real. Except there was something unreal about it. Maybe it was the staring eyes and the fact that its feet walked through the parking curbs instead of stepping over them.</p><p>The straight line it was walking didn’t deviate. And it was coming straight toward us.</p><p>“So this is one of your ghosts you need to deal with?” I asked,</p><p>“One of them. Not our worst.” Sal replied.</p><p>“Worst is what? This one is darned spooky. It would keep most people wondering for months of nightmares,\"</p><p>“True enough. But there are ghosts who are far spookier, and more dangerous.”</p><p>The specter was a slight young girl, dressed in something out of the 50’s, it looked like. Sweater over a simple blouse. Full skirt below the knees, bobby-socks, and saddle-back black-and-white shoes. Her face was blank, her eyes focused on something beyond us.</p><p>She got closer and never saw us or slowed down. She kept going, walking right on through us. I flinched, but the girls didn’t.</p><p>I turned around to see her dissolve right through the front wall of the small tourist shop without slowing her pace.</p><p>Just then, Sal shouted, “Look out!”</p><p>I turned to look and there was some cosmic pinwheel-shaped rift in the sky. A few feet off the ground. Just where we had seen the girl appear. A red-orange fireball pushed out of it and shot right toward us.</p><p>Sal grabbed one of my hands at the same time Jude grabbed the other.</p><p>The view shimmered, just as the fireball was nearly on us...</p><h4>Scroll Up and Get Your Copy Now.</h4>"
